This interactive todo list (auto-saves progress)

Timer for time-bound practice

Formula sheets for quick revision

Study Techniques
Active Recall: Test yourself without looking at notes

Spaced Repetition: Revise topics at increasing intervals

Interleaved Practice: Mix different types of problems

Feynman Technique: Teach concepts to reinforce understanding

⚡ Efficiency Tips
Time Management
Use Pomodoro technique (25 mins study, 5 mins break)

Allocate time based on topic weightage in JEE

Reserve last 3 days for full-length mock tests

Problem Solving Strategy
Level 1: Direct formula application (5-10 mins per question)

Level 2: Concept application (10-15 mins per question)

Level 3: Multi-concept integration (15-20 mins per question)

Revision Strategy
Daily: 30 mins quick revision

Weekly: 3 hours comprehensive revision

Topic completion: 1 hour revision before moving to next

🚨 Emergency Plan (If Falling Behind)
If 2 days behind:
Combine light topics on one day

Reduce PYQs from 30 to 20 per topic

Extend study time by 1 hour daily

If 5+ days behind:
Focus on high-weightage topics only

Skip detailed theory, go directly to PYQs

Use formula sheets for quick revision
